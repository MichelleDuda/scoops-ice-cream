## Design

### Colour
The colour scheme for this website is pink with white and black accents. The pink colour was extracted from the hero image using Microsoft Paint and various hues of that colour were used throughout the site. The colour scheme helps to provide a bright vibrant site that lifts the users mood as they navigate through it. 

### Fonts
Google Fonts was used to import the Lato and Oswald fonts. These were chosen as they compliment each other well and have a simple and modern aesthetic.

## Features

### Logo and Navigation Bar
- A simple and interactive Logo and Navigation Bar is located at the top of each page. 
- The Logo links back to the homepage from any page throughout the site as this is a behaviour that would be expected by the user. 
- The navigation bar is located in the same position on each page and provides links to the three pages in the website (Home, Menu, Contact Us). 
- The page that the user is actively using is underlined in the navigation bar to provide a clear view as to which page they are currently on. 
- A thicker underline appears under each page name as the mouse hovers over it to assist in easy navigation for the user.
- The navigation bar is fully responsive on all screen sizes and collapses to a toggler on smaller screen sizes for ease of use.
