## Design

### Colour
The colour scheme for this website is pink with white and black accents. The pink colour was extracted from the hero image using Microsoft Paint and various hues of that colour were used throughout the site. The colour scheme helps to provide a bright vibrant site that lifts the user's mood as they navigate through it.

### Fonts
Google Fonts was used to import the Lato and Oswald fonts. These were chosen as they complement each other well and have a simple and modern aesthetic.

## Features

### Logo and Navigation Bar
- A simple and interactive Logo and Navigation Bar are located at the top of each page. 
- The Logo links back to the homepage from any page throughout the site as this is a behaviour that would be expected by the user. 
- The navigation bar is located in the same position on each page and provides links to the three pages of the website (Home, Menu, Contact Us). 
- The page that the user is actively using is underlined in the navigation bar to provide a clear view of which page they are currently on. 
- A thicker underline appears under each page name as the mouse hovers over it to assist in easy navigation for the user.
- The navigation bar is fully responsive on all screen sizes and collapses to a toggler on smaller screen sizes for ease of use.

### Landing Image and Call to Action
- The Landing page contains a hero image and text overlay that clearly communicates the purpose of the website.
- A  button stating "View Menu" is also included in the text overlay as a call to action for the user. This serves as a quick link to the menu page.

### About Us Section
- The About Us section is located on the main page under the hero image. It contains plain black text on a white background to maintain a clean and simple appearance, mimicking the clean simplicity of our ingredients.
- This section gives the user a clear description of what the company does and what its main ideals are.

### Footer
- The Footer section contains 3 separate sections with important information that a user could need easy access to - Opening Hours, Social Media Links, and Address/Telephone Number.
- The Footer is the same on all 4 pages of the website - Home, Menu, Contact, and Confirmation pages.
- The footer is placed on a pale pink background in keeping with the overall color scheme and to distinguish it from the rest of the page.

### Page Heading
- Each page contains a heading element that lies over the same background image that was utilized as the hero image on the landing page. This allows all pages of the website to maintain a consistent look.

### Menu Page - Flavors and Price List
- The Flavors section contains the current flavor options available to customers. Each flavor block contains the flavor name, a description, and a photo that relates to the flavor. This section is fully responsive and the blocks resize and wrap depending on the screen size. 
- The Price List section allows users to see the cost of our products and what sizes and options are available to them - cups/cones to enjoy now, milkshakes for something a bit different, or various-sized cartons to take back home to enjoy!

### Contact Us Page
- The Contact section of the page contains both a Contact Us section and a Find Us section. 
- The Contact Us section contains a form that prompts users to enter their name, email address, and a message. Clicking the send button will bring the user to the confirmation page. 
- The Find Us section contains a map embedded from [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com) which the user can interact with along with our address and telephone number.
